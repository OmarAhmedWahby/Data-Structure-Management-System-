# Data-Structure-Management-System-

This is a simple command-line Item Management System implemented in Python. It demonstrates the use of multiple data structures to efficiently manage items with features like adding, viewing, updating, deleting, undo delete, searching, and saving/loading data from a file.

The project integrates:

Linked List (using a Python list) to store and manage items.

Stack to implement an Undo feature for deletions.

Priority Queue (using deque) to manage items by urgent or normal priority.

Binary Search Tree (BST) to perform fast searches by item ID.

Data persistence via JSON file for saving and loading items.

Features
Add new items with unique IDs, including name, description, category, and priority.

View all items.

Update item details.

Delete items with undo option to restore the last deleted item.

Search items quickly by ID using BST.

Save and load items automatically between program runs.
